Plan-driven: Plan everything beforehand, Agile: incremental planning
Waterfall: plan-driven, incremental: mixed
integration & configuration: assembled from existing components, mixed

Waterfall: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment
Drawback: no feedback from users
Used in large system engineering projects

Incremental: specification, development, validation, repeat
Benefit: accomodate changes, rapid deployment
Problems: Opaque process, tech debt

Requirements engineering process: Elicitation, specification, validation
Reducing cost of rework: 
change anticipation (system prototyping), change tolerance (incremental)

Prototype: Initial version for demonstration concepts
Focus on functional, on area not well understood, ignore error checking
Throw-away prototypes, undocumented

Process improvement: measurement, analysis, change

SEI Capability Maturity Model (CMM): 5 levels
Level 1: ad hoc, no process
Level 2: repeatable, documented
Level 3: defined, managed
Level 4: quantitatively managed
Level 5: optimized
